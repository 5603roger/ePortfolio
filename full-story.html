                <p>In this project, I am tasked to develop an innovative food printing system. Although not explicitly stated, we will be 
                    constraining the scope of the existing food printing system to the Evebot food-grade portable printpen.

                <h4>In depth overview</h4>
                <div class="left-align">
                    <p>The team and I first researched on existing food printing systems, and it landed on the topics of 2D and 3D printers. 2D food printers are essentially traditional inkjet printers, whereas 3D food printers operate through an extruder to move along an X-Y-Z axis.</p>
                    <p>Next, through looking into food printing systems, the following functionalities were crafted:</p>
                    <p>Functionalities of food printing systems:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Output materials through the nozzle</li>
                        <li>Move the nozzle in multiple planes</li>
                        <li>Communicate with external devices</li>
                    </ul>

                <h4>Exploration of new ideas</h4>                
                <div class="left-align">
                    <p>With the current functionalities we gathered, we then started looking into a different domain. The topic we landed is regarding the visually impaired and their issue with accessibility of food information. With the problem identified, we then looked into existing solutions such as braille embossers and Navilens, and functionalities of each solution was identified.</p>

                <h4>Choosing the solution</h4>
                <div class="left-align">
                    <p>The team had decided to pick braille as the project focus, due to reasons such as faster information feedback using tactile and smartphone dependency.</p>
                    <p>Functionalities of Braille Embossers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Elevate the surface</li>
                        <li>Transform input into machine actions</li>
                        <li>Communicate with external devices</li>
                        <li>Move the embossing head across the paper</li>

                <h4>Comparing and linking functionalities</h4>
                <div class="left-align">
                    <p>A link between food printing systems and braille embossers was done which led us to ultimately land into the problem of extruding materials to elevate the surface.</p>

                <h4>Concept selection</h4>
                <div class="left-align">
                    <p>In order to create braille onto food product surfaces, different plausible solutions were looked into such as thermal radiation and ultraviolet light. A comparison between 
                        the two did not reach any fruitful conclusion due to their similarities and issues, with the team ultimately sourcing for a different, third alternative.

                <h4>Binder Jetting</h4>
                <div class="left-align">
                <p>Binder Jetting was the solution that the team ended up with and ultimately created potential concepts to work with. So why binder jetting? 
                    Binder jetting involves depositing liquid binding agents into thin layer of powder particles, which we believe is the most feasible. With the 
                    correct amount of liquid and powder, we could potential achieve an optimal result. Most importantly, unlike the other two solutions which required 
                    replacement to be done onto the nozzle, we are able to build upon the existing system.
