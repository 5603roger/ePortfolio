                <p>Project 1 & 2 marked the initial steps into the realm of robotics, focusing on assembling and programming a Lite Kit robot. 
                    This hands-on experience provided foundational knowledge in mechanical assembly, hardware programming, and functional testing.</p>

                        <h3>Context</h3>
                        <p>The project commenced with the introduction of the Lite Kit, consisting of various mechanical and electrical components. Our task was to assemble these parts into a functional robot and 
                            program it to perform specific tasks using Spin language, a specialized hardware programming language.</p>

                <p>This robot was created by fabricating, assembling mechanical and electrical parts. Application of spin language, a specialized hardware programming language, 
                    was used to perform machine-level actions.</p>
